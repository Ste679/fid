<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <b>sous vide</b>. In <b>sous vide</b> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide</b> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
